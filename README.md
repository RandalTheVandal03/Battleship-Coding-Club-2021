# Battleship-Coding-Club-2021
For the students in the coding club. This code is meant for educational purposes, if you're going to show this to others please give me some credit...
I spent a lot of time working on this. Thanks :)

Now that we have the request out of the way, here's how this code works:
-Plays like normal battleship
-It starts with an explanation of how to play.
-Then it requests for you to type in an ordered pair in an (x,y) format 5 times for each ship.
-Once all your ships are set up, the computer will set up its ships as well.
-After that the game will begin, it will give you straightforward instructions so if you read them in the program, you should be fine.

Notes:
-It is programmed so that the computer can NEVER guess an ordered pair twice.
-It is also programmed so you cannot guess an ordered pair more than once either
-You are given the option to see where you have guessed and if it was a hit or miss. 
-A miss on the guess board is denoted as an X and a hit as a O.
